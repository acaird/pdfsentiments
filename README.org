#+TITLE: PDF File Sentiment Analyzer

* Introduction

  I was reading some PDFs that seemed very grumpy, but wanted to see
  if it was actually me who was grumpy.

  I thought one way would be to turn the PDF into text files then use
  some sort of natural language processing sentiment library to
  analyze them.

  I thought this would be harder, but it wasn't very hard, there are
  some nice Python libraries to do all of these things.
